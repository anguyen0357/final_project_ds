## Section 1. Introduction


I will be working alone on this project and that my topic will be on fatal motor vehicle accidents in the United States since I want to know what factors are affecting these crash deaths.

## Section 2. Data Analysis Plan


1. Which states had the highest percentage of drivers involved in fatal collisions due to speeding?
2. Which states had the highest percentage of drivers involved in fatal collisions due to alcohol?
3. Which states had the highest fatal collisions?
4. Which states had the highest car insurance premiums and compare that to the number of fatal collisions?

## Section 3. Data


My dataset had two sources that came from the National Highway Traffic Safety and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. My dataset is in a tidy format since each variable has its own column and that each observation has its own row. My dataset also has eight variable and 51 observations.
